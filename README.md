An `R` Shiny app to draw an ancient Greek town (_polis_) in low-poly, fake 3D graphics.

## Take-aways

* SVG images can be turned into R simple features (sf).
* SVG path chosen to be the "ground" of a building can tell the priority (the order) of layers when multiple objects coexist on a canvas.
* Can pile up objects by faking the ground of things on top to be closer to the observer.

## Work in progress

* Working on colours, daylight changes, etc.
* How to add characters
